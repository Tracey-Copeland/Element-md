                        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        <p>In May of 2019, a small family run cannabis processor entered the market. Founded by  African American woman 
                            entrepreneur Nkechi Iwomi, our social equity business strives to provide the highest quality of cannabis products 
                            for both medical and recreational consumers alike. Our working environment is close knit and familial, enabling us 
                            to create small batch, artisan craft products with integrity and love. Two of our signature products include the 
                            Lux chocolate brand and our Holistic and Spiritual Health (a.k.a H.A.S.H) brands. We never cut corners and strive 
                            to be pioneers in responsible cannabis production and usage.</p>

                        <h3>Butane Hash Oil - (BHO)
                        </h3>
                        <p>Butane Hash Oil (BHO) is an extraction process where Butane is used to separate cannabinoids, terpenes, and other components from harvested 
                            cannabis flower. We use fresh frozen cannabis flower for all of our extracts in order to maintain the plant’s unique cannabinoid 
                            and terpene profile. Much like how fruits are frozen at peak ripeness. This extraction process results in a variety of end products 
                            including live resin, badder or budder, diamonds and sauce, and sugar. Each product has a distinctive effect. Live resin has…Badder 
                            or budder….Diamonds and sauce…Sugar….

                        <h3>Solventless Hash Oil  - (SHO)</h3>
                        <p>Solventless Hash Oil (SHO) is a completely unadulterated cannabis concentrate that has been separated from the original plant material
                            without the use of chemical solvents such as butane, propane, or CO2. The concentrate preserves the full spectrum of cannabinoids and 
                            terpenes of the cannabis plant material, producing a product that delivers a distinct and precise effect, unlike broad spectrum concentrates. 
                            The "Live" version of SHO we produce is obtained from the flower prior to the drying or curing processes,resulting in a product that maximizes 
                            the cannabinoid and terpene profile of the parent material . Live Rosin, a derivative of Solventless Hash Oil, is one of the highest end cannabis 
                            products currently available to consumers.
